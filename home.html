                <p id="size1">Marriage comes with a lot of unavoidable expenses in India and spending a big chunk of
                    your savings
                    on furniture and white goods could be a big challenge. RentoMojo not just took away all our worries
                    but in fact went to the extent of spoiling us. Where I could have owned just some bare essentials
                    after making a huge hole in my pocket or paid unnecessary EMIs, I could smartly own a lot of stuff
                    which would have come much later on my list. Heartfelt thanks to the whole Rentomojo team for making
                    our renting experience completely hassle-free. It has been two great years and I am sure there are
                    many more to come.</p>

                    finally
                    rented one. The delivery guys installed the AC in 2 days. And with a such a low deposit and rent, I
                    didn't have to spend a whole lot for my comfort. Thank you RentoMojo, for being so easy breezy on my
                    pocket.</p>

                    clicks away. The customer support staff was on their toes to help me. Anytime I need something for
